# BubbleBowl.AI

Loads gifs from Spongebob BubbleBowl corresponding to certain frequencies. 
It currently uses if statements to help understand the sound spectrum and fast fourier transformations,
but I plan to recreate this project in tensorflow when I have a better GPU

I built a better version on a drive that I currently do not have access to. If you want a copy, message me on facebook.
